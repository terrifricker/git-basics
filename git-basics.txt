Git Basics

Git is a program that will keep a history of all the changes you make to a software
programming project. It keeps exact copies of previous progress before any new change 
is made.  If a change does not work like it should or introduces a bug, Git allows 
you to go back to the exact copy of the files before the change was made.

Any updates you make to your program are made on copies of your original files.  When 
you decide that the changes should be made to the original files, Git makes the changes 
and gives you a new "version" of the original files, but saves the old originals, just 
in case you need them in the future.

One of the ways that Git makes it easier to program is by letting you keep files at 
a remote website, so that you can work on your project from wherever you are, even if 
you don't have your own computer.  It's also a way to have a backup of your files in 
case your computer files are lost.

Another positive of having your files on a remote website means it is much easier for 
a group of people to work on a project.  More than one person can make changes to the same 
file at the same time.  Each person receives a copy of the current version to work on.  
When each person's copy is ready to be added to make a new version, Git checks for any 
places that more than one person made changes, but that are different.  Git will make 
the person in charge decide which of those changes to keep.
