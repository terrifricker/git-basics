Git Basics
Git keeps track of all changes on a project
      As you work on a project, Git makes a history of all the changes made.  
      It keeps exact copies of previous progress before any new change is made.  
      If a change does not work like it should or introduces a bug, Git allows 
      you to go back to the exact copy of the files before the change was made.
      Changes are made on a copy of the original files.  When it is decided that 
      the changes should be made to the original, Git makes the changes and makes 
      a new "version" of the project files.

Git is a program that will keep of all the changes you make as you work on a software
programming project.  The program can be downloaded from "link".  Once you have made
a set of changes, you tell Git to take a snapshot of your project at this moment in
time.  It will keep keep an exact copy of your project that you can go back to at any 
time.  For example, if you make a set of changes that introduces a bug in your program, 
Git allows you to go back to your files before that change was made.  

Any changes you make to your program are made on copies of your original files.  When 
you decide that the changes should be made to the original files, Git makes the changes 
and gives you a new "version" of the original files, but saves the old originals, just 
in case you need them in the future.

      More than one person can make changes to the same file at the same time.  
      Each person receives a copy of the current version to work on.  When each 
      person's copy is ready to be added to make a new version, Git checks for any 
      places that you both made changes, but that are different.  Git will make 
      the person in charge decide which of those changes to keep.
      
      
      Where does Git live?
