Git Basics
Git keeps track of all changes on a project
      As you work on a project, Git makes a history of all the changes made.  It keeps exact copies of previous progress before any new change is made.  If a change does not work like it should or introduces a bug, Git allows you to go back to the exact copy of the files before the change was made.
      Changes are made on a copy of the original files.  When it is decided that the changes should be made to the original, Git makes the changes and makes a new “version” of the project files.
      More than one person can make changes to the same file at the same time.  Each person receives a copy of the current version to work on.  When each person’s copy is ready to be added to make a new version, Git checks for any places that you both made changes, but that are different.  Git will make the person in charge decide which of those changes to keep.
